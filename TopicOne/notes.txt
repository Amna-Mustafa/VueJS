1. What is VueJS

=> Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. 
    It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
    and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, 
    be it simple or complex.

2. Features of VueJS

    (i) Declarative Rendering: 
        Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.

    (ii) Reactivity: 
        Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.


3. API styles

    Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: Options API and Composition.

    (i) Options
        With Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as data, methods, and mounted. 
        Properties defined by options are exposed on this inside functions.
    
    (ii) Composition
        We define a component's logic using imported API functions.

4. which to choose?

    => Now using Composition API, you can do all those things but in a lot more organized way which makes your code much cleaner and easy to manage.
    => That is why nowadays most developers prefer Compositions API over Options API.
    
5. Mounted() (basically a hook)

    => send an HTTP request to fetch data that the component will then render.
 
 6. Computed vs methods

    => When we need to change data use methods
    => When we need to change the presentation of existing data use computed.
